Thanks for playing Crack-Life: Campaign Mode Remake.

It's a miracle that this mod even exists...
}

END2
{
It all started after I made Crack-Life Remastered for Black Mesa

Then you guys asked for Campaign Mode...
}

END3
{
Technically it was impossible to make 
Campaign Mode on Black Mesa
because I wouldn't be able to
add any new weapons or NPCs at all.

So I had to kinda re-create Black Mesa on standard Half-Life 2
just to make Campaign Mode on it...

Crazy idea, but it worked.

But was it worth it?

END6
{
Well, I don't know
but at least we have Crack-Life on Source now...
